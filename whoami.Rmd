title: "Hi, I am Matt."
description: |
  I am data science and analytics engineer at ETH Zurich, Switzerland. In early 2022, I've joined [cynkra](https://cynkra.com) in an advisory role. I contribute to open source software and the R Project for Statistical Computing in particular. At work, I design solutions for state of the art data processing, management and dissemination.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

```{r,echo=FALSE, out.width="40%"}
knitr::include_graphics("matt.png")
```



I am a collaborator in a National Science Foundation (SNSF) funded National Research Program (NRP 77) and was a co-chair for the 2021 edition of useR!, the annual  conference of the R Project for Statistical Computing. I continue to work in a global 
useR! working group to help a broad variety of R users around the world attend future useR! events. 

Also, I am 1/2 of [banboo data](https://buymeacoffee.com/banboodata), an open source collaboration with @[jburkahrdt](https://github.com/jburkardt) to help website owners analyze their data with open source software.
